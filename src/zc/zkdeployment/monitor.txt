Agent monitor
=============

Deployment agents have a number of failure modes that we need to monitor for:

- Errors during deployment

- agent process deaths

- hangs (possibly not so much since getting ZooKeeper interactions
  under control).

The monitor will seek to detect these failures through the use of a
status file produced by the agent. The status file is essentially a
one-record log file of agent activity.  It contains:

- time (seconds since epoch)

- Pid

- Version

- Status

Where the the version is the version being installed or most recently deployed.

Status is either "done", "error ...", or some string that represents
some action the agent is waiting for, such as installing an RPM or
running a deployment script.  The status may contain spaces.

The agent is considered healthy if:

- The file indicates a status of "done" and a version equal to the
  cluster version, or

- The the status is not error, and the file is younger than some threshold.

The monitor is available as an entry point:

    >>> import pkg_resources
    >>> monitor = pkg_resources.load_entry_point(
    ...         "zc.zkdeployment", "console_scripts", 'monitor')

The monitor is passed the name of a status file.  It accepts options:

--warn, -w
  Warning age threshold, in seconds, defaulting to 200

--error, -e
  Error age threshold, in seconds, defaulting to 600

--zookeeper, -z
  A Zookeeper connection string, defaulting to zookeeper:2181

To create a status file, we'll use a helper function, since we'll be
doing this a lot:

    >>> import time
    >>> def status(version, status, t=None):
    ...     with open('status', 'w') as f:
    ...         f.write("%s 42 %s %s\n" % (t or time.time(), version, status))

    >>> with open('config.ini', 'w') as f:
    ...     f.write(
    ...         '[zkdeployment]\n'
    ...         'run-directory = .\n'
    ...         'host-id = 424242424242\n'
    ...         )

    >>> status(1, 'done')

The monitor also verifies that the state file matches what's recorded in
zookeeper.  Looking at the current tree, we see this node isn't registered
yet:

    >>> import zc.zk
    >>> zk = zc.zk.ZK('zookeeper:2181')
    >>> zk.print_tree('/hosts')
    /hosts
      version = 1

Running the monitor, we're told there's a serious error:

    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    Host not registered
    2

Let's create the host registration:

    >>> zk.create('/hosts/424242424242')
    u'/hosts/424242424242'
    >>> host_properties = zk.properties('/hosts/424242424242')
    >>> host_properties.update(name='app42.example.net')

Running the monitor again before the host's version is stored still
produces an error:

    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    No version information for host
    2

If the version information is set zookeeper, all is good:

    >>> host_properties.update(version='1')
    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    1

If the version isn't a string, that's ok too; it will be converted:

    >>> host_properties.update(version=1)
    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    1

Let's run the monitor:

    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    1

If the status shows an error:

    >>> status(1, 'error')
    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    Error deploying 1
    2

If it shows some other status:

    >>> status(1, 'installing foo')
    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    installing foo

If it's taking a bit long:

    >>> status(1, 'installing foo', time.time() - 300.1)
    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    Too long deploying 1 (installing foo) 300 > 200
    1

Or way too long:

    >>> status(1, 'installing foo', time.time() - 700.1)
    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    Too long deploying 1 (installing foo) 700 > 600
    2

Let's play with command-line options:

    >>> monitor(['config.ini', '-zlocalhost'])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FailedConnect: localhost

    >>> monitor(['config.ini', '-w99', '-e999'])
    Too long deploying 1 (installing foo) 700 > 99
    1

    >>> monitor(['config.ini', '-w99', '-e199'])
    Too long deploying 1 (installing foo) 700 > 199
    2

If the version for the host doesn't match between the status file and
zookeeper, an error is reported:

    >>> host_properties.update(version=2)
    >>> status(1, 'done')

    >>> monitor(['config.ini'])
    Version mismatch (status: 1, zk: 2)
    2

We error if the state file is missing:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.remove('status')
    >>> monitor(['config.ini', '-w99', '-e199'])
    [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './status'
    2
