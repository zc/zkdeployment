- check that rpm is actually installed by checking installed version.

  amongst the many way that yum sucks is that when it can't find a
  requested package, it exits with a 0 exit status.

- zc.zk

  - Fix property links:

    - get_properties
    - dict(props)
    - iter(props)

  - option on import to ignore ephemeral nodes

- zc.recipe.rhrc: process management needs better error handling.

  If the process fails to start, a stop command should be issued.
  The reason for issueing the stop command is that the process may
  have started, but be running incorrectly and times out.  In this
  case, we want to stop it if it's running.

  (Of course, we should make sure other bits are cleaned up too, if
  they aren't already.)


- ISSUE: If we screw up and deploy something that's broken enough to
  not start, we should probably stop deploying it.

- ISSUE: How do we delete customers?

- Agent: when staging, we'll typically need to install dev rpms and
  other dependencies that would normallt appear in the spec file.

  Workaround: have stage-build insert rpms. <shrug>

- Need a --force/-f option in agent.



- Fix zimagent to remove monitors when agent.d files are removed and
  add monitors when agent.d files are added **without restart**!!!

- zc.zk logging snafus:

  - exceptions on shut down

  - dealing with replacement of the log file.

- Include log file in zdaemon configs, so that the logtail command works.

- Allow for a variation of
  hostagent that configures aws.  This could largely function like the
  existing host agent, except:

  - probably want to store ".deployed" files in S3, rather than on a
    particular host.

  - Need special case in hamdling RPM/opt garbage collection.  We
    don't want a local host agent to remove an RPM needed for AWS, but
    not locally, and the other way around.

- OS and move to bitbucket
