- remove /opt/APP diectory when switching from svn to rpm.

- check that rpm is actually installed by checking installed version.

  amongst the many way that yum sucks is that when it can't find a
  requested package, it exits with a 0 exit status.

- zc.zk

  - Fix property links:

    - get_properties
    - dict(props)
    - iter(props)

  - option on import to ignore ephemeral nodes

- Don't fail of there isn't an /etc/APP directory.

  Make one if there isn't one prior to calling zookeeper-deploy.

- The default command timeout isn't long enough to build-out z4m.

-----

- Fix zimagent to remove monitors when agent.d files are removed and
  add monitors when agent.d files are added **without restart**!!!

- zc.zk logging snafus:

  - exceptions on shut down

  - dealing with replacement of the log file.

- Include log file in zdaemon configs, so that the logtail command works.

- Allow for a variation of
  hostagent that configures aws.  This could largely function like the
  existing host agent, except:

  - probably want to store ".deployed" files in S3, rather than on a
    particular host.

  - Need special case in hamdling RPM/opt garbage collection.  We
    don't want a local host agent to remove an RPM needed for AWS, but
    not locally, and the other way around.

- OS and move to github
