- Figure out some more what do do w keys :)

  - Leverage host-specific ssh config to specify key files

  - Leverage global host keys

  - Refactor/test buildoutsftp

- ZRS meta recipe needs to be merged, new rpm

- Verify that agent errors if process doesn't start fast enough.

- urlshortener meta recipe set zdaemon start-test-program

- Fix zimagent to remove monitors when agent.d files are removed and
  add monitors when agent.d files are added **without restart**!!!

- One-off run of hostagent

  - Always converges, doesn't care about cluster version.

  - Makes testing/staging easier.

- zc.zk logging snafus:

  - exceptions on shut down

- why is zktools so fricking slow.

  - why do tests open so many connections to zookeeper

- Include log file in zdaemon configs, so that the logtail command works.

- Allow for a variation of
  hostagent that configures aws.  This could largely function like the
  existing host agent, except:

  - probably want to store ".deployed" files in S3, rather than on a
    particular host.

  - Need special case in hamdling RPM/opt garbage collection.  We
    don't want a local host agent to remove an RPM needed for AWS, but
    not locally, and the other way around.
