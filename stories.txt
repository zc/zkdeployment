Optionally start processes when installing rc scripts
=====================================================

Currently, zc.recipe.rhrc doesn't do process management.  If we want
to make things completely automated, it should.  In addition, it
should have some facility for waiting for processes to start fully.

New options:

manage-processes
  Boolean: if true, then start process on install and stop on
  uninstall.

Status: done


zdaemon optionally waits for a test to succeed on startup
=========================================================

zdaemon grows new options:

startup-test
  PROGRAM

  Wait for program to return a 0 status code.  Run program repeatedly,
  sleeping a second between attempts, until it exits with a 0 status.

  PROGRAM is a test-program path with optional arguments.

startup-timeout
  Wait up to the given number of seconds for startup or until the
  child process stops being restarted, whichever is lesser, before
  reporting a startup failure.

Agent synchronizes deployments on a host with ZK tree
=====================================================

See agent description in README.rst

zookeeper-deploy for URL shortener
==================================

zookeeper-deploy for ZRS
========================

Zookeeper-synchronization agent
===============================

The ZooKeeper synchronization agent polls VCS for changes to a
ZooKeeper tree for its cluster.  When it identifies a change, it
checks it for errors.

If there is an error, it sends an error email.

If there is no error, it updates the ZooKeeper tree by:

- Importing file that's changed.

- Updating the ``/hosts`` ``version`` property with the new VCS
  version.

ZooKeeper check-in agent
========================

The ZooKeeper checkin agent is a VCS pre-commit hook that checks a
cluster's trees for errors:

- Can the tree be parsed with zc.zk import script.

- Does the model imply inconsistent RPM versions or patch levels for a
  host.
